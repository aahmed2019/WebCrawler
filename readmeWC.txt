To run this GUI we need to first install  Win32 GUI in the machine. 

Then run from command prompt 

		C:/perlgui.pl

This will create a interface . 

In the gui the seed should be given as starting with http:// .
  		http://cornell.edu

As i have set my directory path as C:\\Perl\\eg\\IRProject.

It should be updated to the current directory to get it run. 

Several log files will be saved to this directory as it is set in this directory.
